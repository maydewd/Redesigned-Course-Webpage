  "synopsis" : {
    "text": "Algorithms are a cornerstone of computational sciences and the need for efficient algorithms is ubiquitous in modern technology. However, the primary goals of algorithm design, the resources that need to be optimized, and even the model of computation varies widely between application areas. In this course, we will study some of the fundamental principles of algorithm design that appear in multiple areas and have had broad impact. In addition, we will focus on the mathematical tools that are frequently used in the theoretical analysis of algorithms, and study how such analysis, in turn, influences algorithm design. The course will be at an undergraduate level.",
